# The REPL

## Questions to ask

## Answers

- Read Eval print Loop, create a file and use the "use" keyword
- When we make a mistake we are faced with three types of errors
  - Syntax error - we wrote the wrong format for the expression we are trying to use, it means nothing
  - Type checking error - We are passing in the wrong types, the rules of type checks are failing
  - Evaluation Error - We might have caused an exception or an infinite loop or a wrong answer
